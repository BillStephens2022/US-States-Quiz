# U.S. States Quiz<br>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description

  This is an educational game built with Python where the player enters as many U.S. states as he/she can.  As a new state is entered, the state name fills on on the appropriate place on the USA map.  The player will name as many states as they can until they get to 50.  If the player exits before entering all states, the missing states will be written to a .csv file for the player to review.
